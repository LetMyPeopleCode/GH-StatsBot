# microClone
A set of scripts for making it easier to download parts of directories

## Why microClone?
During my time managing a "cookbook" repository for an employer, containing dozens of code samples and demos, it became very apparent that this was a bad approach for both users and the company. A user who wanted one 2k sample had to download a 50MB repository and then extract it. Meanwhile, it was hard for the people creating these samples and demos to get data on how often they were being downloaded and understand which samples/demos were actually useful for people.

The concept behind `microClone` is to help make it WAY easier for users of these repos to download just the samples and demos they want while providing more solid and actionable data about their GitHub usage.
